Explanations of the technologies used.
* This program is a Ruby on Rails web application which uses a variety of gems such as Kaminari(pagination) and Bootstrap(CSS framework) to enhance it's functionality. The database created stores user, course, and comment information. It is a basic web application whose purpose is to allow users to search, view, comment on and sign up for art and design courses in their area.

Installation/startup instructions.
* Please refer to the link posted above for access to the app.

Unsolved problems, etc.
*There are still a few bugs in the program that I need to sort out. Basic improvements I'd like to make are to:
- Turn flash notices into nicer looking modals or messages.
- Add time view to courses.
- Edit course page should default time and price.
- Add classes that users have created to the users page.
- Toggle the enroll/unenroll button.
- Change the gravatar default.
- Make home page images dynamic.
- Work on CSS to make the app look more like a palette.
- Refactor the code to make it cleaner.
